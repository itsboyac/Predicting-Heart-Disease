# Predicting-Heart-Disease
In this project we will use KNN classifier model to predict the happening of heart disease.

## Steps
1. Load and explore the heart disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
2. Preprocess the data, including handling missing values and scaling features
3. Split the data into training and testing sets
4. Implement a KNN classifier and evaluate its initial performance
5. Optimize the model by tuning the number of neighbors (k)
6. Analyze feature importance and their impact on heart disease prediction
7. Interpret the results and summarize key findings for healthcare professionals
